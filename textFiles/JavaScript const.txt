Previous Next ? ECMAScript 2015 ES2015 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned: Example const PI = 3.141592653589793; PI = 3.14; // This will give an error PI = PI + 10; // This will also give an error Try it Yourself ? Block Scope Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when it comes to Block Scope. The x declared in the block, in this example, is not the same as the x declared outside the block: Example var x = 10; // Here x is 10 { const x = 2; // Here x is 2 } // Here x is 10 Try it Yourself ? You can learn more about Block Scope in the previous chapter: JavaScript Let. Assigned when Declared JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared: Incorrect const PI; PI = 3.14159265359; Correct const PI = 3.14159265359; Not Real Constants The keyword const is a little misleading. It does NOT define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value. Because of this, we cannot change constant primitive values, but we can change the properties of constant objects. Primitive Values If we assign a primitive value to a constant, we cannot change the primitive value: Example const PI = 3.141592653589793; PI = 3.14; // This will give an error PI = PI + 10; // This will also give an error Try it Yourself ? Constant Objects can Change You can change the properties of a constant object: Example // You can create a const object: const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; // You can change a property: car.color = "red"; // You can add a property: car.owner = "Johnson"; Try it Yourself ? But you can NOT reassign a constant object: Example const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; car = {type:"Volvo", model:"EX60", color:"red"}; // ERROR Try it Yourself ? Constant Arrays can Change You can change the elements of a constant array: Example // You can create a constant array: const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; // You can change an element: cars[0] = "Toyota"; // You can add an element: cars.push("Audi"); Try it Yourself ? But you can NOT reassign a constant array: Example const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"]; // ERROR Try it Yourself ? Browser Support The const keyword is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 or earlier. The following table defines the first browser versions with full support for the const keyword: Chrome 49 IE / Edge 11 Firefox 36 Safari 10 Opera 36 Mar, 2016 Oct, 2013 Feb, 2015 Sep, 2016 Mar, 2016 Redeclaring Redeclaring a JavaScript var variable is allowed anywhere in a program: Example var x = 2; // Allowed var x = 3; // Allowed x = 4; // Allowed Redeclaring or reassigning an existing var or let variable to const, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed: Example var x = 2; // Allowed const x = 2; // Not allowed { let x = 2; // Allowed const x = 2; // Not allowed } Redeclaring or reassigning an existing const variable, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed: Example const x = 2; // Allowed const x = 3; // Not allowed x = 3; // Not allowed var x = 3; // Not allowed let x = 3; // Not allowed { const x = 2; // Allowed const x = 3; // Not allowed x = 3; // Not allowed var x = 3; // Not allowed let x = 3; // Not allowed } Redeclaring a variable with const, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed: Example const x = 2; // Allowed { const x = 3; // Allowed } { const x = 4; // Allowed } Hoisting Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top (if you don't know what Hoisting is, read our Hoisting Chapter). You can use a var variable before it is declared: Example carName = "Volvo"; // You CAN use carName here var carName; Try it Yourself ? Variables defined with const are not hoisted to the top. A const variable cannot be used before it is declared: Example carName = "Volvo"; // You can NOT use carName here const carName = "Volvo"; ? Previous Next ?
