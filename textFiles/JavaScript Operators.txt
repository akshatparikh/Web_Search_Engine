Previous Next ? Example Assign values to variables and add them together: var x = 5; // assign the value 5 to x var y = 2; // assign the value 2 to y var z = x + y; // assign the value 7 to z (x + y) Try it Yourself ? The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable. Assignment var x = 10; Try it Yourself ? The addition operator (+) adds numbers: Adding var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x + y; Try it Yourself ? The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. Multiplying var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x * y; Try it Yourself ? JavaScript Arithmetic Operators Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers: Operator Description + Addition - Subtraction * Multiplication ** Exponentiation (ES2016) / Division % Modulus (Division Remainder) ++ Increment -- Decrement Arithmetic operators are fully described in the JS Arithmetic chapter. JavaScript Assignment Operators Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables. Operator Example Same As = x = y x = y += x += y x = x + y -= x -= y x = x - y *= x *= y x = x * y /= x /= y x = x / y %= x %= y x = x % y **= x **= y x = x ** y The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable. Assignment var x = 10; x += 5; Try it Yourself ? Assignment operators are fully described in the JS Assignment chapter. JavaScript String Operators The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings. Example var txt1 = "John"; var txt2 = "Doe"; var txt3 = txt1 + " " + txt2; The result of txt3 will be: John Doe Try it Yourself ? The += assignment operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings: Example var txt1 = "What a very "; txt1 += "nice day"; The result of txt1 will be: What a very nice day Try it Yourself ? When used on strings, the + operator is called the concatenation operator. Adding Strings and Numbers Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string: Example var x = 5 + 5; var y = "5" + 5; var z = "Hello" + 5; The result of x, y, and z will be: 10 55 Hello5 Try it Yourself ? If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string! JavaScript Comparison Operators Operator Description == equal to === equal value and equal type != not equal !== not equal value or not equal type > greater than < less than >= greater than or equal to <= less than or equal to ? ternary operator Comparison operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter. JavaScript Logical Operators Operator Description && logical and || logical or ! logical not Logical operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter. JavaScript Type Operators Operator Description typeof Returns the type of a variable instanceof Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type Type operators are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter. JavaScript Bitwise Operators Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers. Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number. Operator Description Example Same as Result Decimal & AND 5 & 1 0101 & 0001 0001 1 | OR 5 | 1 0101 | 0001 0101 5 ~ NOT ~ 5 ~0101 1010 10 ^ XOR 5 ^ 1 0101 ^ 0001 0100 4 << Zero fill left shift 5 << 1 0101 << 1 1010 10 >> Signed right shift 5 >> 1 0101 >> 1 0010 2 >>> Zero fill right shift 5 >>> 1 0101 >>> 1 0010 2 The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned examples. But JavaScript uses 32-bit signed numbers. Because of this, in JavaScript, ~ 5 will not return 10. It will return -6. ~00000000000000000000000000000101 will return 11111111111111111111111111111010 Bitwise operators are fully described in the JS Bitwise chapter. Test Yourself With Exercises Exercise: Multiply 10 with 5, and alert the result. 
alert(10  5);
