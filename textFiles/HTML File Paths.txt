Previous Next ? Path Description <img src="picture.jpg"> picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page <img src="images/picture.jpg"> picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder <img src="/images/picture.jpg"> picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current web <img src="../picture.jpg"> picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder HTML File Paths A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure. File paths are used when linking to external files like: Web pages Images Style sheets JavaScripts Absolute File Paths An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet file: Example <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> Try it Yourself ? The <img> tag is explained in the chapter about HTML Images. Relative File Paths A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page. In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web: Example <img src="/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> Try it Yourself ? In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder: Example <img src="images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> Try it Yourself ? In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level above the current folder: Example <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain"> Try it Yourself ? Best Practice It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible). When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future public domains. ? Previous Next ?
