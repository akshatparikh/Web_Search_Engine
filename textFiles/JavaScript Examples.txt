Statements Explained JavaScript Comments Single line comments Single line comments at the end of a line Multiple lines comments Single line comment to prevent execution Multiple lines comment to prevent execution Comments Explained JavaScript Variables JavaScript variables JavaScript variables as algebra JavaScript numbers and strings JavaScript var keyword. Declaring many variables in one statement Declaring many variables multiline A variable without a value returns the value undefined Re-declaring a variable will not destroy the value Adding JavaScript numbers Adding JavaScript strings Adding strings and numbers Variables Explained JavaScript Arithmetic The addition (+) operator The subtraction (-) operator The multiplication (*) operator The division (/) operator The modulus (%) operator The increment (++) operator The decrement (--) operator Arithmetic Explained JavaScript Assignment The = assignment operator The += assignment operator The -= assignment operator The *= assignment operator The /= assignment operator The %= assignment operator Assignment Explained JavaScript String Concatenation Adding two strings together using the concatenating (+) operator Adding two strings together with a space in the first string Adding two strings together with a space in between Adding two strings together using using the += operator Adding strings and numbers Concatenation Explained JavaScript Data Types Declare (create) strings Declare (create) numbers Declare (create) an array Declare (create) an object Find the type of a variable Adding two numbers and a string Adding a string and two numbers An undefined variable An empty variable Data types Explained JavaScript Objects Create a JavaScript variable Create a JavaScript object Create a person object (single line) Create a person object (multiple lines) Access object properties using .property Access object properties using [property] Access a function property as a method Access a function property as a property Objects Explained JavaScript Functions A simple function A function with an argument A function with an argument 2 A function that returns a value A function that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius A function call without () Functions Explained JavaScript Events An onclick event changes an HTML element An onclick event changes its own element An onclick event calls a function Events Explained JavaScript Strings Strings can be written with single or double quotes. Show some string examples Backslash before quotes accepts quotes as quotes. Find the length of a string You can break text string with a backslash. You cannot break code with a backslash. Find the position of the first occurrence of a text in a string - indexOf() Search for a text in a string and return the text if found - match() Replace characters in a string - replace() Convert string to upper case - toUpperCase() Convert string to lower case - toLowerCase() Split a string into an array - split() Strings Explained JavaScript Numbers Numbers can be written with or without decimals Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with exponent notation Number are considered accurate only up to 15 digits Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate But it helps to multiply and divide by 10 Adding two numbers results in a new number Adding two numeric strings results in a concatenated string Adding a number and a numeric string also results in a concatenated string Adding a numeric string and a number also results in a concatenated string Common mistake when adding strings and numbers 1 Common mistake when adding strings and numbers 2 JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers when dividing JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers when multiplying JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers when subtracting JavaScript will NOT convert strings to numbers when adding A number divided by a string is NaN (Not a Number) A number divided by a numeric string is a number The global JavaScript function isNaN() returns if a value is a number Using NaN in a mathematical operation will always return NaN Using NaN in a mathematical string operation will concatenate NaN NaN (Not a Number) is a number (Yes! typeof NaN returns number) Infinity is returned if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number Division by zero also generates Infinity Infinity is a number (typeof Infinity returns number) Constants, preceded by 0x, are interpreted as hexadecimal The toString() method can output numbers as hex, octal, and binary Numbers can be objects Numbers and objects cannot be safely compared Objects and objects cannot be safely compared Numbers Explained JavaScript Number Methods The toString() method converts a number to a string The valueOf() method returns a number as a number The toExponential() returns a number with exponential notation The toFixed() method rounds a number to a number of digits The toPrecision() method a number written with a specified length The global method Number() converts variables to numbers The global method Number() can even convert dates to numbers The global method parseInt() converts strings to numbers The global method parseFloat() converts strings to numbers MAX_VALUE returns the largest possible number in JavaScript MIN_VALUE returns the smallest possible number in JavaScript POSITIVE_INFINITY represents infinity POSITIVE_INFINITY is returned on overflow NEGATIVE_INFINITY represents negative infinity NEGATIVE_INFINITY is returned on overflow NaN Represents "Not-a-Number" Arithmetic performed on a string will result in NaN Using a Number property on a variable will return undefined Numbers Methods Explained JavaScript Maths Math.PI returns the value of PI Math.round(x) returns the rounded value of x Math.pow(x, y) returns the value of x to the power of y Math.sqrt(x) returns the square root of x Math.abs(x) returns the absolute (positive) value of x Math.ceil(x) returns the value of x rounded up Math.floor(x) returns the value of x rounded down Math.sin(x) returns the sin of the angle x (given in radians) Math.cos(x) returns the cosin of the angle x (given in radians) Math.max() return the number with the highest value from a list of arguments Math.min() to return the number with the lowest value from a list of arguments Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit Maths Explained JavaScript Random Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (included) and 1 (excluded) How to return a random integer between 0 and 9 (both included) How to return a random integer between 0 and 10 (both included) How to return a random integer between 0 and 99 (both included) How to return a random integer between 0 and 100 (both included) How to return a random integer between 1 and 10 (both included) How to return a random integer between 1 and 100 (both included) How to return a random integer between x (included) and y (excluded) How to return a random integer between x and y (both included) Random Explained JavaScript Dates Use Date() to display today's date and time Use getFullYear() display the year Use getTime() to calculate the number of milliseconds since 1970 Use setFullYear() to set a specific date Use toUTCString() to convert today's date (according to UTC) to a string Use getDay() to display the weekday as a number Use getDay() and an array to display the weekday as a name Display a clock Dates Explained JavaScript Arrays Create an array I Create an array II Access an array element Change an array element Access a full array Find the length of an array Loop through an array Add an element to an array Add undefined "holes" to an array How to recognize an array I How to recognize an array II Arrays Explained JavaScript Array Methods Add an element to an array Remove the last element of an array -
