Previous Next ? It is time to create a real AngularJS Application. Make a Shopping List Lets use some of the AngularJS features to make a shopping list, where you can add or remove items: My Shopping List {{x}}? Add {{errortext}} Application Explained Step 1. Getting Started: Start by making an application called myShoppingList, and add a controller named myCtrl to it. The controller adds an array named products to the current $scope. In the HTML, we use the ng-repeat directive to display a list using the items in the array. Example So far we have made an HTML list based on the items of an array: <script> var app = angular.module("myShoppingList", []); app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) { $scope.products = ["Milk", "Bread", "Cheese"]; }); </script> <div ng-app="myShoppingList" ng-controller="myCtrl"> <ul> <li ng-repeat="x in products">{{x}}</li> </ul> </div> Try it Yourself ? Step 2. Adding Items: In the HTML, add a text field, and bind it to the application with the ng-model directive. In the controller, make a function named addItem, and use the value of the addMe input field to add an item to the products array. Add a button, and give it an ng-click directive that will run the addItem function when the button is clicked. Example Now we can add items to our shopping list: <script> var app = angular.module("myShoppingList", []); app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) { $scope.products = ["Milk", "Bread", "Cheese"]; $scope.addItem = function () { $scope.products.push($scope.addMe); } }); </script> <div ng-app="myShoppingList" ng-controller="myCtrl"> <ul> <li ng-repeat="x in products">{{x}}</li> </ul> <input ng-model="addMe"> <button ng-click="addItem()">Add</button> </div> Try it Yourself ? Step 3. Removing Items: We also want to be able to remove items from the shopping list. In the controller, make a function named removeItem, which takes the index of the item you want to remove, as a parameter. In the HTML, make a <span> element for each item, and give them an ng-click directive which calls the removeItem function with the current $index. Example Now we can remove items from our shopping list: <script> var app = angular.module("myShoppingList", []); app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) { $scope.products = ["Milk", "Bread", "Cheese"]; $scope.addItem = function () { $scope.products.push($scope.addMe); } $scope.removeItem = function (x) { $scope.products.splice(x, 1); } }); </script> <div ng-app="myShoppingList" ng-controller="myCtrl"> <ul> <li ng-repeat="x in products"> {{x}} <span ng-click="removeItem($index)">&times;</span> </li> </ul> <input ng-model="addMe"> <button ng-click="addItem()">Add</button> </div> Try it Yourself ? Step 4. Error Handling: The application has some errors, like if you try to add the same item twice, the application crashes. Also, it should not be allowed to add empty items. We will fix that by checking the value before adding new items. In the HTML, we will add a container for error messages, and write an error message when someone tries to add an existing item. Example A shopping list, with the possibility to write error messages: <script> var app = angular.module("myShoppingList", []); app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope) { $scope.products = ["Milk", "Bread", "Cheese"]; $scope.addItem = function () { $scope.errortext = ""; if (!$scope.addMe) {return;} if ($scope.products.indexOf($scope.addMe) == -1) { $scope.products.push($scope.addMe); } else { $scope.errortext = "The item is already in your shopping list."; } } $scope.removeItem = function (x) { $scope.errortext = ""; $scope.products.splice(x, 1); } }); </script> <div ng-app="myShoppingList" ng-controller="myCtrl"> <ul> <li ng-repeat="x in products"> {{x}}<span ng-click="removeItem($index)">&times;</span> </li> </ul> <input ng-model="addMe"> <button ng-click="addItem()">Add</button> <p>{{errortext}}</p> </div> Try it Yourself ? Step 5. Design: The application works, but could use a better design. We use the W3.CSS stylesheet to style our application. Add the W3.CSS stylesheet, and include the proper classes throughout the application, and the result will be the same as the shopping list at the top of this page. Example Style your application using the W3.CSS stylesheet: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css"> Try it Yourself ? ? Previous Next ?
