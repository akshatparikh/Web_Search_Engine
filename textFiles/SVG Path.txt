Previous Next ? SVG Path - <path> The <path> element is used to define a path. The following commands are available for path data: M = moveto L = lineto H = horizontal lineto V = vertical lineto C = curveto S = smooth curveto Q = quadratic B?zier curve T = smooth quadratic B?zier curveto A = elliptical Arc Z = closepath Note: All of the commands above can also be expressed with lower letters. Capital letters means absolutely positioned, lower cases means relatively positioned. Example 1 The example below defines a path that starts at position 150,0 with a line to position 75,200 then from there, a line to 225,200 and finally closing the path back to 150,0: Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG. Here is the SVG code: Example <svg height="210" width="400"> <path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" /> </svg> Try it Yourself ? Example 2 B?zier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. Generally, the user selects two endpoints and one or two control points. A B?zier curve with one control point is called a quadratic B?zier curve and the kind with two control points is called cubic. The following example creates a quadratic B?zier curve, where A and C are the start and end points, B is the control point: A B C Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG. Here is the SVG code: Example <svg height="400" width="450"> <path id="lineAB" d="M 100 350 l 150 -300" stroke="red" stroke-width="3" fill="none" /> <path id="lineBC" d="M 250 50 l 150 300" stroke="red" stroke-width="3" fill="none" /> <path d="M 175 200 l 150 0" stroke="green" stroke-width="3" fill="none" /> <path d="M 100 350 q 150 -300 300 0" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5" fill="none" /> <!-- Mark relevant points --> <g stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="black"> <circle id="pointA" cx="100" cy="350" r="3" /> <circle id="pointB" cx="250" cy="50" r="3" /> <circle id="pointC" cx="400" cy="350" r="3" /> </g> <!-- Label the points --> <g font-size="30" font-family="sans-serif" fill="black" stroke="none" text-anchor="middle"> <text x="100" y="350" dx="-30">A</text> <text x="250" y="50" dy="-10">B</text> <text x="400" y="350" dx="30">C</text> </g> </svg> Try it Yourself ? Complex? YES!!!! Because of the complexity involved in drawing paths it is highly recommended to use an SVG editor to create complex graphics. ? Previous Next ?
