Previous Next ? JavaScript Arithmetic Operators Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables). Operator Description + Addition - Subtraction * Multiplication ** Exponentiation (ES2016) / Division % Modulus (Remainder) ++ Increment -- Decrement Arithmetic Operations A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers. The two numbers can be literals: Example var x = 100 + 50; Try it Yourself ? or variables: Example var x = a + b; Try it Yourself ? or expressions: Example var x = (100 + 50) * a; Try it Yourself ? Operators and Operands The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands. The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator. Operand Operator Operand 100 + 50 Adding The addition operator (+) adds numbers: Example var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x + y; Try it Yourself ? Subtracting The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers. Example var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x - y; Try it Yourself ? Multiplying The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. Example var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x * y; Try it Yourself ? Dividing The division operator (/) divides numbers. Example var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x / y; Try it Yourself ? Remainder The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder. Example var x = 5; var y = 2; var z = x % y; Try it Yourself ? In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder. In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division. Incrementing The increment operator (++) increments numbers. Example var x = 5; x++; var z = x; Try it Yourself ? Decrementing The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers. Example var x = 5; x--; var z = x; Try it Yourself ? Exponentiation The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. Example var x = 5; var z = x ** 2; // result is 25 Try it Yourself ? x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y): Example var x = 5; var z = Math.pow(x,2); // result is 25 Try it Yourself ? Operator Precedence Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. Example var x = 100 + 50 * 3; Try it Yourself ? Is the result of example above the same as 150 * 3, or is it the same as 100 + 150? Is the addition or the multiplication done first? As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first. Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses: Example var x = (100 + 50) * 3; Try it Yourself ? When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first. When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right: Example var x = 100 + 50 - 3; Try it Yourself ? JavaScript Operator Precedence Values Pale red entries indicates ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) or higher. Value Operator Description Example 20 ( ) Expression grouping (3 + 4) 19 . Member person.name 19 [] Member person["name"] 19 () Function call myFunction() 19 new Create new Date() 17 ++ Postfix Increment i++ 17 -- Postfix Decrement i-- 16 ++ Prefix Increment ++i 16 -- Prefix Decrement --i 16 ! Logical not !(x==y) 16 typeof Type typeof x 15 ** Exponentiation (ES2016) 10 ** 2 14 * Multiplication 10 * 5 14 / Division 10 / 5 14 % Division Remainder 10 % 5 13 + Addition 10 + 5 13 - Subtraction 10 - 5 12 << Shift left x << 2 12 >> Shift right x >> 2 12 >>> Shift right (unsigned) x >>> 2 11 < Less than x < y 11 <= Less than or equal x <= y 11 > Greater than x > y 11 >= Greater than or equal x >= y 11 in Property in Object "PI" in Math 11 instanceof Instance of Object instanceof Array 10 == Equal x == y 10 === Strict equal x === y 10 != Unequal x != y 10 !== Strict unequal x !== y 9 & Bitwise AND x & y 8 ^ Bitwise XOR x ^ y 7 | Bitwise OR x | y 6 && Logical AND x && y 5 || Logical OR x || y 4 ? : Condition ? "Yes" : "No" 3 += Assignment x += y 3 /= Assignment x /= y 3 -= Assignment x -= y 3 *= Assignment x *= y 3 %= Assignment x %= y 3 <<= Assignment x <<= y 3 >>= Assignment x >>= y 3 >>>= Assignment x >>>= y 3 &= Assignment x &= y 3 ^= Assignment x ^= y 3 |= Assignment x |= y 2 yield Pause Function yield x 1 , Comma 5 , 6 Expressions in parentheses are fully computed before the value is used in the rest of the expression.
