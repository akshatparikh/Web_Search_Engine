Previous Next ? The two most common HTTP methods are: GET and POST. What is HTTP? The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers. HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server. Example: A client (browser) submits an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content. HTTP Methods GET POST PUT HEAD DELETE PATCH OPTIONS The GET Method GET is used to request data from a specified resource. GET is one of the most common HTTP methods. Note that the query string (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request: /test/demo_form.php?name1=value1&name2=value2 Some other notes on GET requests: GET requests can be cached GET requests remain in the browser history GET requests can be bookmarked GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data GET requests have length restrictions GET requests are only used to request data (not modify) The POST Method POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The data sent to the server with POST is stored in the request body of the HTTP request: POST /test/demo_form.php HTTP/1.1 Host: w3schools.com name1=value1&name2=value2 POST is one of the most common HTTP methods. Some other notes on POST requests: POST requests are never cached POST requests do not remain in the browser history POST requests cannot be bookmarked POST requests have no restrictions on data length The PUT Method PUT is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. The difference between POST and PUT is that PUT requests are idempotent. That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result. In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly have side effects of creating the same resource multiple times. The HEAD Method HEAD is almost identical to GET, but without the response body. In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but will not return the list of users. HEAD requests are useful for checking what a GET request will return before actually making a GET request - like before downloading a large file or response body. The DELETE Method The DELETE method deletes the specified resource. The OPTIONS Method The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource. Compare GET vs. POST The following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST. GET POST BACK button/Reload Harmless Data will be re-submitted (the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted) Bookmarked Can be bookmarked Cannot be bookmarked Cached Can be cached Not cached Encoding type application/x-www-form-urlencoded application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data. Use multipart encoding for binary data History Parameters remain in browser history Parameters are not saved in browser history Restrictions on data length Yes, when sending data, the GET method adds the data to the URL; and the length of a URL is limited (maximum URL length is 2048 characters) No restrictions Restrictions on data type Only ASCII characters allowed No restrictions. Binary data is also allowed Security GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL Never use GET when sending passwords or other sensitive information! POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs Visibility Data is visible to everyone in the URL Data is not displayed in the URL ?
