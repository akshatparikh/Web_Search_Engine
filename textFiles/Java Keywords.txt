Previous Next ? Java Reserved Keywords Java has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers: Keyword Description abstract A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from) assert For debugging boolean A data type that can only store true and false values break Breaks out of a loop or a switch block byte A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 and 127 case Marks a block of code in switch statements catch Catches exceptions generated by try statements char A data type that is used to store a single character class Defines a class continue Continues to the next iteration of a loop const Defines a constant. Not in use - use final instead default Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement do Used together with while to create a do-while loop double A data type that can store whole numbers from 1.7e?308 to 1.7e+308 else Used in conditional statements enum Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type exports Exports a package with a module. New in Java 9 extends Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class) final A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override) finally Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not float A data type that can store whole numbers from 3.4e?038 to 3.4e+038 for Create a for loop goto Not in use, and has no function if Makes a conditional statement implements Implements an interface import Used to import a package, class or interface instanceof Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface int A data type that can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647 interface Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods long A data type that can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775808 module Declares a module. New in Java 9 native Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file (but in another language) new Creates new objects package Declares a package private An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class protected An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses public An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class requires Specifies required libraries inside a module. New in Java 9 return Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method short A data type that can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767 static A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class strictfp Restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations super Refers to superclass (parent) objects switch Selects one of many code blocks to be executed synchronized A non-access modifier, which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time this Refers to the current object in a method or constructor throw Creates a custom error throws Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method transient A non-accesss modifier, which specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state try Creates a try...catch statement var Declares a variable. New in Java 10 void Specifies that a method should not have a return value volatile Indicates that an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory" while Creates a while loop Note: true, false, and null are not keywords, but they are literals and reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers. ?
