Previous Next ? Google Maps - Overlays Overlays are objects on the map that are bound to latitude/longitude coordinates. Google Maps has several types of overlays: Marker - Single locations on a map. Markers can also display custom icon images Polyline - Series of straight lines on a map Polygon - Series of straight lines on a map, and the shape is "closed" Circle and Rectangle Info Windows - Displays content within a popup balloon on top of a map Custom overlays Google Maps - Add a Marker The Marker constructor creates a marker. Note that the position property must be set for the marker to display. Add the marker to the map by using the setMap() method: Example var marker = new google.maps.Marker({position: myCenter}); marker.setMap(map); Google Maps - Animate the Marker The example below shows how to animate the marker with the animation property: Example var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position:myCenter, animation:google.maps.Animation.BOUNCE }); marker.setMap(map); Google Maps - Icon Instead of Marker The example below specifies an image (icon) to use instead of the default marker: Example var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position:myCenter, icon:'pinkball.png' }); marker.setMap(map); Google Maps - Polyline A Polyline is a line that is drawn through a series of coordinates in an ordered sequence. A polyline supports the following properties: path - specifies several latitude/longitude coordinates for the line strokeColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the line (format: "#FFFFFF") strokeOpacity - specifies the opacity of the line (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) strokeWeight - specifies the weight of the line's stroke in pixels editable - defines whether the line is editable by users (true/false) Example var myTrip = [stavanger,amsterdam,london]; var flightPath = new google.maps.Polyline({ path:myTrip, strokeColor:"#0000FF", strokeOpacity:0.8, strokeWeight:2 }); Google Maps - Polygon A Polygon is similar to a Polyline in that it consists of a series of coordinates in an ordered sequence. However, polygons are designed to define regions within a closed loop. Polygons are made of straight lines, and the shape is "closed" (all the lines connect up). A polygon supports the following properties: path - specifies several LatLng coordinates for the line (first and last coordinate are equal) strokeColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the line (format: "#FFFFFF") strokeOpacity - specifies the opacity of the line (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) strokeWeight - specifies the weight of the line's stroke in pixels fillColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the area within the enclosed region (format: "#FFFFFF") fillOpacity - specifies the opacity of the fill color (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) editable - defines whether the line is editable by users (true/false) Example var myTrip = [stavanger,amsterdam,london,stavanger]; var flightPath = new google.maps.Polygon({ path:myTrip, strokeColor:"#0000FF", strokeOpacity:0.8, strokeWeight:2, fillColor:"#0000FF", fillOpacity:0.4 }); Google Maps - Circle A circle supports the following properties: center - specifies the google.maps.LatLng of the center of the circle radius - specifies the radius of the circle, in meters strokeColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the line around the circle (format: "#FFFFFF") strokeOpacity - specifies the opacity of the stroke color (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) strokeWeight - specifies the weight of the line's stroke in pixels fillColor - specifies a hexadecimal color for the area within the circle (format: "#FFFFFF") fillOpacity - specifies the opacity of the fill color (a value between 0.0 and 1.0) editable - defines whether the circle is editable by users (true/false) Example var myCity = new google.maps.Circle({ center:amsterdam, radius:20000, strokeColor:"#0000FF", strokeOpacity:0.8, strokeWeight:2, fillColor:"#0000FF", fillOpacity:0.4 }); Google Maps - InfoWindow Show an InfoWindow with some text content for a marker: Example var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({ content:"Hello World!" }); infowindow.open(map,marker); ?
